A python color palette generator, using tkinter and numpy. 

Allows user to upload an image through a dialog.

The app then finds the 10 most common colors in the image, rendering 10 buttons, giving them the background color of these most common colors;
rendering the hex code text in the complimentary color of the background.

These buttons can then be clicked on, which copies the hex code into the user's clipboard.

Needs a small improvment, to evaluate if the complimentary color of the button text is contrasty enough with the background, and adjust accordingly.
